## ✨ Features

### 🗺️ Real-Time Map Tracking
- **Multiple map types**: AMap (Standard / Satellite) / Vector map / Carto (Light · Dark · Voyager) / OSM (Standard · Humanitarian) / OpenTopo terrain / Esri (Streets · Imagery), switchable in Settings with one tap
- **Vector map**: rendered on-device with `flutter_map` + `vector_map_tiles`, low data usage and crisp zooming, **no API key required**, WGS-84 coordinates; supports my track and selected station track
- **AMap tiles (GCJ-02)**: aligns seamlessly for domestic positioning in China, with built-in WGS-84 ↔ GCJ-02 conversion
- **Live station display**: every station at a glance; online / moving / stationary / offline distinguished by green / blue / yellow / grey, active stations pulse-animated
- **Clustering**: stations are grouped into cluster balls (count shown, tap to zoom in) when dense, greatly reducing lag; can be toggled anytime
- **My track**: your own movement trail drawn on the map (blue polyline, up to 200 points)
- **Station track**: selected station's history drawn as colored polyline
- **Callsign labels**: station callsign shown directly on map markers
- **Focus & locate**: jump from station list / detail to the map centered on a station, with smooth zoom animation and "fit all stations"

### 📡 Position Beacons
- One-tap position reporting with customizable comment
- Full APRS 1.0 standard format, compatible with mainstream APRS software
- Automatically attaches altitude, speed, course, battery, etc. (configurable)
- Adjustable reporting interval; home screen shows live countdown and beacon count
- **Demo mode** lets you try all features even without a GPS fix

### 💬 Messaging
- Unified conversation list for **private chat + group chat**, chat like any IM app
- Full message acknowledgment (ACK) with auto-reply support and Chinese messages

### 🚒 Station Identification
- Auto-detects **FMO** stations
- Marks fellow **APRSlocus** stations (comment contains `APRSlocus`), showing version / battery / altitude etc.
- **Official APRS device identification**: uses the aprs.org device database `aprsorg/aprs-deviceid` (tocalls); recognizes each station's vendor + model + device class (rig / HT / tracker / app / software / iGate / digipeater / weather …) from the packet destination callsign, with a bundled offline snapshot + online auto-update
- Full **37 official symbol tables, 3571 standard icons**, official PNG preferred with Material fallback

### 🛰️ Station List & Details
- **Multi-dimension filter**: status (Online / Moving / Stationary), APRS type (Vehicle / Fixed / Digipeater / Weather), software (APRSlocus), device class & specific model (from official tocalls), country/region receive filter, favorites — single-row chips, tap to filter
- **Smart search**: real-time search by callsign / type / comment / grid / device name (debounced, smooth with many stations)
- **Sorting**: callsign / last heard / distance / status
- **Details page**: lat/lng, Maidenhead grid, speed, altitude, course, distance & bearing to me, weather, track, forwarding-path visualization (hop chain with tappable digis), recent raw packets
- **Quick actions**: copy coords / grid, show on map, navigate, and **online lookup (QRZ callsign DB / aprs.fi position & track)**

### 📦 Packets & Logs
- **Raw packet view**: monospace + timestamps, long-press to copy
- **Parsed list mode**: position / message / weather / status / object categorized with type filter & full-text search
- **Debug log page**: leveled logs (debug / info / warn / error), one-tap copy / clear

### ⚡ Connection & Background
- **Auto-connects to APRS-IS public servers**, stays online in background
- TCP socket (desktop / mobile) and WebSocket (web) implementations
- Default server `rotate.aprs2.net:14580`; parses `# logresp` for login verification; yellow banner on home if Passcode unverified
- **Progressive reconnect** (8 → 16 → 32 → 60 s)
- **Android foreground location service**: continuous GPS reporting + system notification; notification bar can connect / disconnect the server or exit the app in one tap
- Push notifications for received messages / group events
- Country/region receive filter and lat/lng + radius range filter (50 / 100 / 200 / 500 / 1000 / 2000 km presets)

### 🎨 Personalization & UX

## 🚀 Quick Start

First launch enters a **6-step OOBE wizard**, fully visual:

| Step | What |
|------|------|
| 1️⃣ | Choose interface language (Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English / follow system) |
| 2️⃣ | Welcome: learn core features, try **Demo Mode** first |
| 3️⃣ | Enter your amateur radio **callsign** (e.g. `BG7LZQ-3`) and pick an **SSID suffix** (mobile recommended `3`, HT recommended `7`) |
| 4️⃣ | Pick the **symbol** representing your station type (car / house / person / truck / bike / RV / weather station / police) |
| 5️⃣ | Choose which **stations to receive** by country/region (China by default); toggle "other stations" to receive digipeaters / weather / FMO / APRSlocus |
| 6️⃣ | Configure server & **Passcode**; done — auto-connects to APRS-IS and starts beaconing |

> **About Passcode**: entering `-1` lets you connect, but an **unverified Passcode cannot send/receive messages properly**. Generate your own at [APRS Passcode lookup](https://aprs.cool/AprsPG) and fill it in.

After the wizard the app connects to APRS-IS, starts reporting position, and receives nearby stations.

## 📡 Beacons & Symbols

### Example Beacon

APRSlocus position beacons follow the APRS 1.0 standard:

```
BG7LZQ-3>APALOC,TCPIP*:!2148.90N/11049.14E/> /A=000328 090/050 Bat:70% APRSlocus v1.6.18
```

- `APALOC` in the path marks this station as using APRSlocus
- Comment auto-attaches altitude (`/A=000328`), course/speed (`090/050`), battery (`Bat:70%`)

### Symbol Reference

| Symbol | Meaning | Symbol | Meaning |
|------|------|------|------|
| `>` | Car | `-` | House |
| `[` | Person | `k` | Truck |
| `b` | Bike | `R` | RV |
| `W` | Weather station | `!` | Police |
| `i` | FMO station | `'` | Small aircraft |

Full **37 official symbol tables, 3571 standard icons**, all rendered from bundled official PNGs.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Can't receive / send messages?</b></summary>

In most cases your **Passcode is unverified**. Using `-1` connects but cannot send/receive messages. Generate your own at [APRS Passcode lookup](https://aprs.cool/AprsPG) and set it under "Connection". If the server returns `unverified` after login, a yellow banner appears at the top of Home — tap "Go to settings" to fix it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: How do I set the Passcode?</b></summary>

In OOBE step 6 or "Settings → Connection", generate a Passcode from your **full callsign (with SSID, e.g. BG7LZQ-3)** and enter it.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Connection fails / keeps dropping?</b></summary>

The app retries progressively (8 → 16 → 32 → 60 s). If it keeps failing, check your network, confirm the server (`rotate.aprs2.net:14580`) and that the port isn't blocked; switch servers in "Connection" then tap "Reconnect".
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: No nearby stations on my phone?</b></summary>

Check whether the target country/region is ticked under "Receive filter" and that your range (lat/lng + radius) covers your location. Only China (prefix B) stations are received by default.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Does background location drain battery?</b></summary>

Android keeps APRS online with a foreground location service. Adjust the beacon interval under "Location / Beacon", or disable beaconing and report manually to save power. The notification bar can exit the app in one tap.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Map looks wrong on Windows?</b></summary>

Switch to **Vector map** under "Display → Map type" (no API key, best compatibility), or try Carto / OSM / Esri international sources.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Install says signature conflict / downgrade?</b></summary>

Since 1.5.2 Android uses the official release signature, identical between CI and local builds — install over the existing version directly. From much older versions, uninstall first then reinstall.
</details>
